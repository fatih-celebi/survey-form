        My name is Fatih Celebi. I am 27 years old. I am from Turkey. I have been living in the UK for one and half year. Moving to here have made me feel better than ever before. After moving here, I focused on improving my English and participating some volunteering activities. In the last few months, I interested in coding as well. I liked it after trying it in the basic levels and decided that it could be an ideal career for me. In this blog, I will be giving details about my volunteering activities, my hobbies and my career plans.

        <h2>My Volunteering Activities</h2>
          <p class="text">
As volunteering activities,  we carried out a park cleaning activity in Dialogue Society in cooperation with the Bolton Council. We participated this Play Park cleaning activity to raise awareness about environmental cleaning. 
I also participated a Community Christmas Dinner organised by Dialogue Society in partnership with Summit Education Society with a theme of "Rekindling the Community Spirit". The event aimed to build stronger community relations and to stand together against the troubles we have been facing as humanity, in celebration of our unity and in peace. In this meaningful event, I also had the presenter role. By doing such a contribution to the event increased my self confidence in public speaking. 
My another contribution to the society is publishing an online magazine named "Summit" to share knowledge and experiences within communities. My role was leading the team as an editor of the Magazine.  For interview section of the Summit, we interviewed with many people from very different backgrounds. This studies enabled me to have knowledge about other people`s expereince. </p>

      <h2 >My Career Plan</h2>  
    <p class="text">  
I  graduated from Law Faculty in Turkey. So my career in Turkey was different from Coding or Computer Science. However, I think soft skills that I have gained from my old career can be an upside in Information Technology Industry. I need to be improve my technical skills as well with the help of CYF team.
